<h1>beecrowd problem 3303 - Big Word:</h1>

Recently Juquinha learned to say big words. These Brazilian Portuguese words are commonly called "palavrao"s. Amazed at the discovery of the boy, her mother forbade him to say any "palavrao", about the risk of the boy losing his allowance.

As Juquinha hates being without an allowance, he hired you to develop a program to tell him if a word is a "palavrao" or not.

"Palavrao"s are words that contain ten or more characters, all other words are considered "palavrinha"s.
